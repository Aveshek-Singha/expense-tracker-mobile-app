# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current Input component in the expense tracker app is missing essential TextInput props, specifically the placeholder prop, which prevents placeholder text from displaying in input fields. This feature will enhance the Input component to properly support all necessary TextInput properties and improve the user experience by showing helpful placeholder text in form fields.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see placeholder text in input fields, so that I understand what information should be entered in each field.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an Input component is rendered with a placeholder prop THEN the system SHALL display the placeholder text in the input field
2. WHEN the input field is empty THEN the system SHALL show the placeholder text in the specified placeholder color
3. WHEN the user starts typing THEN the system SHALL hide the placeholder text

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Input component to support all common TextInput props, so that I can configure input behavior without modifying the component.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I pass TextInput props to the Input component THEN the system SHALL forward those props to the underlying TextInput
2. WHEN I pass value, onChangeText, secureTextEntry, or other TextInput props THEN the system SHALL apply them correctly
3. WHEN I pass both custom props and TextInput props THEN the system SHALL handle both without conflicts

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper TypeScript support for Input component props, so that I get type safety and autocomplete when using the component.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use the Input component in TypeScript THEN the system SHALL provide type checking for all supported props
2. WHEN I pass invalid props THEN the system SHALL show TypeScript errors
3. WHEN I use the component THEN the system SHALL provide autocomplete for available props
